Build a "Transformers" (yes yes... like רובוטריקים) merchandise trading store.
2. The store should be a website (desktop only) that allows both sellers and buyers to trade (the sellers to post merchandise for sale and the buyers to be able to buy it)
3. You dont have to implement any real payment system. A simple "balance" feature for each user for each bought or sold transaction should decrease or increase the user's cash balance in the system (which is of course displayed somewhere)
4. You'll need a simple registration system (as stupid as it gets).
5. Each user should have a user page with his relevant info (from the registration) and credit balance

Important notes:
1. You can pick any technology/ programming language you like for the website and it's backend (ReactJS and Node.js should do the trick, but are totally up to you).
2. The user registration data and transaction info should be stored in a DB of your choice (some SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.)
3. The site should have a logging system and the logs should be written to some centralized sytem (pick whatever you like, as long as it's not plain terminal printing or storing the logs in a local filesystem).
4. You don't have actually to build a deployment to the systems from the previous 2 items (2 and 3). Using a publically accessible system (like Mongo Atlas) or a local installation (with provided installation instructions) of those systems is good enough.
5. The desired result is that I can boot your application on my workstation (pick your preferred OS - Windows, MacOS or Linux) and it would function properly.

A few bonuses:
1. Pretty UI is big bonus.
2. Small, reusable components, divided into small functions and classes are a BIG bonus.
3. Propper logging throughout the system to document events and help with debugging.
4. Being able to deploy the logging system and the DB.


































This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
